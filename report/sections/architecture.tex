\section{Architecture}
intro to the section, what are we going to talk about?
\subsection{Project's architecture}
architecture of Najeeb's code, where are my functions?
scheme on how the system (server, epochs, peers, peer rounds) works\\

In the typical FL (a.k.a. horizontal FL), K peers and an aggregator server
A collaboratively build a global model W. In each training iteration
t 2 [1, T], the server randomly selects a subset of peers S

After that, the server distributes the current global model Wt to all peers
in S. Besides Wt, the server sends a set of hyper-parameters to be used
to train the local models, which includes the number of local epochs E,
the local batch size BS, and the learning rate h.

After receiving Wt, each
peer k 2 S divides her local data Dk into batches of size BS and performs
E optimization steps on Dk to compute her update Wt+1, which she up- k
loads to the server.

The federated averaging algorithm (FedAvg, McMa- han et al., 2017a) is usually employed to perform the aggregation
Note that FedAvg is the standard way to aggregate updates in FL and is
not meant to counter security attacks
