\section{Implementation}
intro to the section, what are we going to talk about?

\subsection{Dataset}
we began by using the MNIST dataset, but we had to change to the CIFAR-10 dataset because of the size of the MNIST dataset.\\
explain

• MNIST. It contains 70K grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9 with a size of 28fi 28fi 1 pixels (LeCun et al., 1999). It is split into a training set of 60K examples and a testing set of 10K examples.
• CIFAR10. It is made up of 60K color images belonging to 10 dif- ferent classes (Krizhevsky, 2009). The images have a size of 32 fi 32 fi 3 pixels and are split into a training set of 50K examples and a testing set of 10K examples.

both of them are defined as image classification datasets


\subsection{Creating the flipping functions}
What is it? where can it be found? pros?
